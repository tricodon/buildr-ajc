== Install
 gem install buildr-ajc

== Usage
* Require +ajc+ in your +buildfile+:
 require 'ajc'

* Add initial method to your +buildr+ project definition:
 define 'aspects' do
   compile_with_ajc
 end

* Now while compiling the project, the +ajc+ compiler detects aspects in your project sources and weaves matching classes in your projetc sources and test sources

* Adding aspects from other libs (libs must be in dependencies of the project) by adding :aspectpath option as array of names that matching the required libs by simple text pattern \*name\* ( e.g. 'name' matches the-name-1.0.jar):
 compile_with_aspectj :aspectpath => ['spring-aspects', 'my-aspects']

* Other options:
